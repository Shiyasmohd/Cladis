## Inspiration
Disaster are the natural events in the wheel of time, but what makes it dreadful is the lack of timely reflex action over its management. Unlike other foreign countries, India with its mere technology has been victims of such disasters for a long time. And this is something that needs to be solved with the right usage of the enriched human resource of our country.

## What it does
Cladis is a disaster management web app that helps the victims to let the world know that they are in trouble and seek help. The biggest breakthrough here is decentralization of disaster management, it means letting anyone help the victims other than government organizations which sometimes fail due to overloaded cases. It can also be used as Crisis management app by the local body (for the small cases like accidents)

## How we built it
Through various brainstorming and online meetings, we gave our idea a basic structure. Thereafter began work with the ui and moved to the web app. Constant communication and teamwork made this project possible


## What's next for Cladis
Decentralization of working on these events will always make the response faster and might even save lives. It can be even used by the police, organizations and any citizens regardless of any centralized power

## Build with
React.js
